1. Prerequisites
   
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher)

npm or yarn

Expo CLI (npm install -g expo-cli)

iOS/Android Simulator or the Expo Go app on a physical device.

2. Project Architecture
   
The application uses a modern Redux Toolkit structure to manage state and API interactions.

redux/store.ts: The central state container.

redux/reducers/shoppingSlice.ts: Contains the logic for API calls (Thunks) and state mutations.

ShoppingList.tsx: The main UI component using hooks to interact with Redux.



Here is the comprehensive documentation for the Shopping List App. This guide covers the technical architecture, installation steps, and a user manual.

3. Syncing
The app automatically fetches the latest data from the server every time you open it.
 This means if you share the API URL with a partner, you will both see the same list.

## API Schema Reference(for developers)
For developers looking to extend the app, the data follows this structure:

<table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Field</th>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>id</strong></td>
                <td><code>String</code></td>
                <td>Unique identifier generated by the server.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>name</strong></td>
                <td><code>String</code></td>
                <td>The name of the grocery item.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>qty</strong></td>
                <td><code>String</code></td>
                <td>Quantity or measurement description (e.g., "2 lbs", "1 pack").</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>checked</strong></td>
                <td><code>Boolean</code></td>
                <td>Completion status (<code>true</code> if item is bought, <code>false</code> otherwise).</td>
